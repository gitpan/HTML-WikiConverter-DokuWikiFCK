1. INSTALLATION

HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK

This package includes DokuWikiFCK.pm, a perl extension to DokuWik.pm and fckg, a 
plugin which supports the new syntax created by DokuWikiFCK.pm. 

    a. FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION
    A first-time installation is best done using CPAN: perl -MCPAN -e 'install 
    HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK' This will install all of the Perl dependencies 
    you need as well as the fckg DokuWiki plugin. Please Note: You should be 
    prepared to provide the installer with the full path to your DokuWiki plugins, 
    for instance: /var/www/html/dokuwiki/lib/plugins 
    The fckg plugin will then be installed in your plugins directory. 
    You will also be asked if you would like to replace the DokuWiki mediamanager 
    with a revised version which is needed for the FCKeditor The revised version is 
    entirely compatible with DokuWiki. Your original DokuWiki mediamanager.php will 
    be backed up. 

    b. SUBSEQUENT OR MANUAL INSTALLATION
    The DokuWikiFCK package can be downloaded from this web site or from CPAN at:
                      
    http://search.cpan.org/search?module=HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK 
  
    To install, the standard instructions are: 
    gzip -dc HTML-WikiConverter-DokuWikiFCK-0..tar.gz | tar -xvf - 
    OR 
    tar -xzf HTML-WikiConverter-DokuWikiFCK-0.XX.tar.gz 
    perl Makefile.PL 
    make 
    make test 
    make install 


    c. A COMPLETELY MANUAL INSTALL
    DokuWikiFCK.pm subclasses DokuWiki.pm in order to give additional functionality 
    to the FCK editor. First, place DokuWikiFCK.pm and DokuWikiFCKN.pm in the perl5 
    directory, where DokuWiki.pm is installed. This should be: 
    usr/lib/perl5/site_perlHTML/WikiConverter. Then install the fckg plugin in the 
    DokuWiki plugins directory. The following perl dependencies are required: 
      HTML::WikiConverter
      HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki


2. SPACE-BAR POSITIONING
    The FCKeditor supports positioning of text and images using the Outdent, Indent, 
    and Justification toolbar items. Justification is left, right, and center. 
    Outdent and Indent position elments at 40 pixel intervals. DokuWikiFCK has 
    extended this functionality to enable positioning by use of the space-bar.  The 
    editor's toolbar functions have priority over space-bar positioning. 
    Until version 3.0.1 of Firefox, Firefox ignored spaces when switching from the 
    FCKeditor the browser; that is, it collapsed runs of contiguous spaces to a 
    single space.  Presumably, it treated spaces found in the editor like spaces in 
    an HTML document instead of as non-breaking spaces, which have a width set by 
    the current font and font-size.  This meant, for example, that if you pushed 
    something over from the left margin, using the space-bar, when you switched over 
    to the browser it would be back at the left margin.  To compensate, DokuWikiFCK 
    saved runs of three or more spaces as medial dots.  This required a great deal 
    of &#8220;book-keeping&#8221;.  First, since the middot is a printable character, 
    DokuWikiFCK had to make sure that it didn't display; then it had to convert the 
    middot to a non-breaking space when displaying in the browser; and it had to 
    keep track of whether it was in IE or in Firefox, since the problem didn't exist 
    in IE.  Finally, it was not an ideal solution, because the middot is not the 
    same width as a space character and since in non-Latin alaphabets the middot may 
    have a valid orthographical use. 

    Because of the changes in Firefox 3.0.1, this work-around is no long needed.  
    Therefore, as of version 24 of DokuWikiFCK, the middot workaround is no longer 
    supported.  However, version 24 of DokuWikiFCK recognizes that there may still 
    be users of DokuWiki who have not upgraded to Firefox 3 or who might be using 
    browsers incompatible with the changes to version 24.  The administrator can 
    assign these users to a special DokuWiki group (or groups) using the 
    Configuration Manager. The default name for this group is middot. Users 
    assigned to this goup will use DokuiWikiFCKN instead of DokuWikiFCK.  
    DokuWikiFCKN retains the middot protocol.  In version 24, DokuWikiFCK and 
    DokuWikiFCKN are as much as possible homogenous, and there should be little if 
    any difference between documents edited using either of these modules when the 
    documents are displayed in the browser.   However, there is no guarantee that 
    DokuWikFCKN will keep up with changes to DokuWikiFCK.  One hopes that users will 
    upgrade to compatible browsers. 

    Version 24 of DokuWikiFCK has been tested on IE6 and 7, Firefox 3.0.1, Safari 
    3.1.2 (Windows). 

3. INSERTING AND UPLOADING IMAGES
    The DokuWiki media manager is used for uploading files and the FCKEditor media 
    manager is used for inserting files in the FCK editor's editing space. To 
    implement inserting and uploading of images: 
         a. replace the copy of DokuWiki's mediamanager.php in tpl/ with the one included 
            in this package.
         b. create a userfiles directory in your document root directory. Inside 
            userfiles, create a symbolic link that points to the dokuwiki media directory:
                     userfiles
                     image  -> /data/media

4. MEDIA MANAGER IN MULTIPLE DOKUWIKI INSTALLATIONS

    If you are running more than one dokuwiki on your server,each using DokuWikiFCK, 
    and if each has its own media directory, you will have to create a 'userfiles' 
    directory for each installation, and each 'userfiles' will need an 'image' link 
    to its own media directory. The way to do this is as follows: 
        a. for each installation create a 'userfiles' directory
        b. in each 'userfiles' create a link to its media directory
        b. go to fckg/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php.config.php and in 
        config.php make the following edits:

            ADD: 
            $UserFilesRealPath = /absolute/path/to/userfiles/'; 

            CHANGE: 
            Path to user files relative to the document root: 
            $Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/userfiles/'; 
            Note: 'path/to' does not include the document root directory itself! See the 
            example below. 
            //$Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = &#8221;&#8221; 
            $Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = $UserFilesRealPath; 

            EXAMPLE: 
            Your absolute path is: /var/www/html/dw_1/userfiles 
            Your document root is: /html/ 
            $UserFilesRealPath = '/var/www/html/dw_1/userfiles/'; 
            $Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/dw_1/userfiles/'; 
            $Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = $UserFilesRealPath; 
            The rest follows the instructions for a single userfiles directory in 3 above. 

5. FCKEDITOR TOOLBAR
    The following FCKEditor Toolbar items are supported: 

            FCKConfig.ToolbarSets["Dokuwiki"] = [
               ['Bold','Italic','Underline','StrikeThrough','-','Subscript','Superscript'],
               ['OrderedList','UnorderedList'],  ['Outdent','Indent'],
               ['JustifyCenter','JustifyLeft','JustifyRight'],
               ['Rule', 'Block_Q'], ['Smiley', 'SpecialChar'], [],
               ['Cut','Copy','Paste','PasteText', 'PasteWord', 'SpellCheck', 'Find'],
               ['Style'], ['FontFormat','FontName','FontSize'],
               ['Undo','Redo','RemoveFormat', '-','Table','Format_Table'],
               ['TextColor','BGColor', 'Plugin_Tool', 'Trim_Spaces','Delete_P'],
               ['Link','Unlink'], ['Image', 'Source' ],
               ['About']
             ] ;

    The Quick Reference to the Standard toolbar items shows the toolbar icons of the 
    tools supported by DokuWikiFCK, and it briefly describes the use of each tool. 
    The toolbar can be customized. See the documentation on the FCKeditor site. 

    DOKUWIKIFCK TOOLS AND TOOLBAR EXTENSIONS

    DokuWikiFCK implements a number of tools of its own and extensions to the 
    standard toolbar items. These are all described fully on the features page. More 
    briefly, they are: 

    The plugin tool ('Plugin_Tool')
      a. This tool maintains the integrity of syntax plugins. 
      b. It escapes plugin markup for plugins which use angle brackets, so that the 
        brackets will not be mistaken for HTML syntax.
      c. It guarantees that plugin syntax which produces output will not be replaced by 
        that output. This is essential for plugins that refresh their output when the 
        page is refreshed.
      d. It guarantees that javascript scripts needed for the plugins will be sent to 
        the browser.
        See the features page for details. 

    The Table Formatting tool ('Format_Table')
        This tool supports an extended set of options for formatting tables. See the 
        features page section on formatting tables. There is also a 'Styles' option 
        which implements the creation of standard DokuWiki table headers. See table 
        headers on the features page. 

    The BlockQuote Tool ('Block_Q')
        This is an extended version of the Blockquote toolbar item that comes standard 
        with the FCKEditor. Our extension supports border styles and colors, font 
        selection and background colors. 

    The Paragraph to LineBreak Tool ('Delete_P')
        The FCKeditor uses paragraphs as its basic unit of separation between text 
        blocks.   This tool will convert paragraphs to line-breaks, making it possible 
        to create sequences of short single-spaced lines, as in I.b. above.  Otherwise, 
        single-spacing would happen only within paragraphs, and sequences of short lines 
        would be double spaced  (i.e. each it own paragraph).  The ony other way in 
        DokuWiki to get sequences of single-spaced lines is in lists. 

    The Trim Spaces Tool ('Trim_Spaces')
        The FCKeditor often populates a page with blank paragraphs.  This tool 
        eliminates them.  It was developed before the appearance of Firefox 3 when 
        unnecessary inserted spaces also found their way into documents.  The 'spaces' 
        mode of this tool is operable only with the older protocol governing runs of 
        spaces (see 2. above). 

   Spell Checker
        DokuWikiFCK supports the FCKeditor SpellerPages facility.  To use this facility,
        you must have GNU aspell installed and all required aspell dictionaries. The
        aspell binary must be in the web server's path.  On Mac OS X, for instance,
        the ports command installs in the /opts directory and so /opts/bin
        will very likely not be in the web server's path; hence a symbolic link from /usr/bin
        to the aspell binary will be needed.
      
6. LOCK TIME OUT AND AUTO-DRAFT SYSTEM

With version 24 of DokuWikiFCK, the FCKeditor is fully tied into DokuWiki's auto-draft and
file locking systems. Until this tie-in, DokuWiki was unable to monitor the FCKeditor
editing space for keyboard activity. Unable to detect evidence of editing activity, it
would not save drafts and would would issue a lock time out warning every 14 minutes.
Version 23 of DokuWikiFCK dealt with the latter by disabling the time out warning, because
users found the warnings a nuisance. With version 24, this is no longer necessary; time
out warnings and the auto-drafts work as they should. 

Issues: 

    1. Because making this tie-in took a bit of technological legerdemain, DokuWikiFCK
provides for the possibility that it might fail in untested browsers or under certain
browser conditions. If so, a check box will appear with the following label : Disable
editor time-out messsages. Administrators may not want to allow all users to have the
privilege; therefore, there is a setting in the Configuration Manager which enables the
administrator to set a group which has this privilege. The default setting for this group
is ANY, which means that all users have this privilege should they need it; there is no
need to create a group called ANY .
    2. In cases where a draft file is recovered, the draft is not in DokuWiki format but in
HTML, which is how the FCKeditor sees it.
    3. There is a Refresh button, which enables the user to renew the lock wthout having to
Save or switch to Preview.

     http://www.dokuwiki.org/locking

7. SUPPORT FOR LARGE FILES

On some systems the shell cannot pass through large files between scripts, hence the files
would be lost.  Large files are now saved to a tmp file by save.php
and reloaded for processing in saveFCK.pl The files are saved to a temp file ins Dokuiki's 
data/tmp directory (this must be writable by the web server).

Configuration options for handling large files (found in Configuration Manager):
 big_files:     default=FALSE. 
                Must be set to TRUE for large files facility to take effect.
 big_file_sz:   default=65000 bytes.
                Files larger than big_file_sz will be treated as Large Files; 
 big_file_tm:   default=15 seconds.
                If a large file takes longer big_file_tm seconds to be
                processed, the procesing will be aborted and the original text will be saved--
                which means that the current edits will be lost.
