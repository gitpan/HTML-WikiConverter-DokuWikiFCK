HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK version 0.07

This package includes DokuWikiFCK.pm, a perl extension to DokuWik.pm
and fckg a plugin which supports the new syntax created by DokuWikiFCK.pm.
fckg includes a slightly altered version the fckw plugin, which is needed
for DokuWikiFCK.pm and both fckw and fckg cannot both  

This is the first CPAN-based version.  Susbsequent versions will indiciate
what changes have been made and will specify what needs to be done to upgrade.


1. INSTALLATION

a. FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION
  A first-time installation is best done using CPAN:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK'
    
    This will install all of the Perl dependencies you need as well as
    the fckg DokuWiki plugin. 
   		
    You should be prepared to provide the installer with the
    full path to your DokuWiki plugins, for instance:

             /var/www/html/dokuwiki/lib/plugins

    The fckg plugin will then be installed in your plugins directory.
    You will also be asked if you would like to replace the DokuWiki  
    mediamanager with a revised version which is needed for the FCKeditor
    The revised version is entirely compatible with DokuWiki. Your 
    original DokuWiki mediamanager.php will be backed up.


b. SUBSEQUENT OR MANUAL INSTALLATION
    
    The DokuWikiFCK package can be downloaded from CPAN at:

          http://search.cpan.org/search?module=HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK

    To install, the standard instructions are:

        gzip -dc  HTML-WikiConverter-DokuWikiFCK-0.07.tar.gz  | tar -xvf -
               OR
        tar -xzf HTML-WikiConverter-DokuWikiFCK-0.07.tar.gz

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
  
   
If you have previously installed DokuWikiFCK, consult this README document.  If the only
change is to DokuWikiFCK.pm, you can simply replace the old version of DokuWikiFCK.pm
with this new one.  You should normally find it in the following perl5 directory:

    usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/<perl_version>/HTML/WikiConverter


c. A COMPLETELY MANUAL INSTALL

DokuWikiFCK.pm subclasses DokuWiki.pm in order to give additional
functionality to the FCK editor.  First, place DokuWikiFCK.pm in the perl5 directory,
where DokuWiki.pm is installed. This should be: 
    usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/<perl_version>/HTML/WikiConverter
Then install the fckg plugin in the DokuWiki plugins directory.

The following perl modules are required:
	HTML::WikiConverter
	HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki
        HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK (included in this package)


2. SPACE-BAR POSITIONING

The FCK Editor supports positioning of text and images using the Outdent, Indent,
and Justification icons.  Justification is left, right, and center.  Outdent
and Indent position elments at 40 pixel intervals. DokuWikiFCK has extended this
functionality to enable positioning by use of the space-bar.  Space-bar positioning
is on by default. It uses a place-holder character, which it substitutes
for spaces. 

To disable space-bar positioning, set the Perl variable $SPACEBAR_NUDGING to 1:
  my $SPACEBAR_NUDGING = 1;
This will be found at the top of the DokuWikiFCK.pm file.


3. INSERTING AND UPLOADING IMAGES

In the current version of fckw, the DokuWiki media manager is used for uploading files
and the FCKEditor media manager is used for inserting files in the FCK editor's
editing space.


To implement inserting and uploading of images:
	1.replace the copy of DokuWiki's mediamanager.php in tpl/<default> with 
the one included in this package. 

        2. create a userfiles directory in your doucment root directory.  Inside userfiles,
create a symbolic link that points to the dokuwiki media directory:
             userfiles
                image -> <dokuwiki_directory>/data/media


4. FCKEDITOR TOOLBAR

The following FCKEditor Toolbar items are supported:

FCKConfig.ToolbarSets["Dokuwiki"] = [   
  ['Bold','Italic','Underline','StrikeThrough','-','Subscript','Superscript'],   
  ['OrderedList','UnorderedList'],['Outdent','Indent'],   
  ['JustifyCenter','JustifyLeft','JustifyRight'],
  ['Table','Rule', 'Blockquote'], ['Smiley', 'SpecialChar'], [],  
  ['Cut','Copy','Paste','PasteText' ],   
  ['Undo','Redo','RemoveFormat', '-','Find'],   
  '/',   
  ['Style'],
  ['TextColor','BGColor'],['FontFormat','FontName','FontSize'],   
   ['Link','Unlink'], ['Image'],  
  '/',
  ['Source','-','About']   
] ;
